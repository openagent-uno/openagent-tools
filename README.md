# OpenAgent Tools

Independent, reusable filesystem, editor, shell, web search, Meta Ads and
device capabilities. Hosts may call them as Python packages, expose them
through the neutral tool protocol or register them as MCP servers where
supported.

Start with [docs/README.md](docs/README.md). The public capability guide is at
[openagent.uno](https://openagent.uno/guide/mcp), and the verified beta artifacts
are published in the repository releases.

## Official connectors

[`packages/connectors`](packages/connectors/README.md) owns the shared Go catalog, adapters, runner and authentication broker. The standalone Python/MCP adapter is `packages/connectors-python`; release bundles and checksums are built with `scripts/build_connectors.py`. [Authentication deployment runbook](deploy/connector-auth/README.md).
